            One hundred years after the battle that led to the death of the
            Prodigies. Link awakens from a long sleep in the Sanctuary of
            Rebirth. A female voice calls him and implores him to wake up. He no
            longer has any memory of his past. He meets an old man who turns out
            to be the spirit of King Rhoam. The latter explains to him that
            Zelda, locked up in Hyrule Castle, is fighting alone against Ganon,
            "The Scourge", and asks him to go and fight him, before he breaks
            free and destroys the world. To understand what happened a century
            ago, Link must call on several characters capable of telling him
            about the events prior to his sleep. Impa entrusts him with twelve
            photographs of places to find his memories. The hero travels through
            Hyrule and returns to the places of his past. He boards the four God
            Beasts and frees the souls of the four Prodigies from Ganon's
            shadows, allowing them to once again control their creature. After
            obtaining the Legendary Sword, which can be found in the Lost Woods,
            Link enters Hyrule Castle and defeats Ganon, "The Scourge". He then
            restores peace to the kingdom and allows the spirits of King Rhoam
            and the four Prodigies to fly away.
