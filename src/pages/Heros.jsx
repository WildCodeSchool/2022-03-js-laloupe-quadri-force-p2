      <section className="one">
        <img src="src/assets/images/Mipha.webp" alt="status" />
        <p>
          Mipha is the Prodigy of the Zoras, of which she is the princess. She
          is the daughter of King Dorefah and the sister of Prince Sidon. She is
          the pilot of the divine water creature Vah&apos;reRuta. 100 years
          before the events of the game, Mipha was in love with Link, whose
          childhood friend she was. During her childhood, she was educated by
          the Zora Knights, who cherished her. She was spear-trained by Governor
          Etorpe, using the weapon she was given at birth, the Radiant Scale
          Spear. After Ruta&apos;res discovery, she reportedly insisted on
          piloting her, her healing gifts making her an ideal candidate. She
          will be chosen by King Roham to be the Prodigy of the Zoras and
          therefore be under the orders of Princess Zelda and pilot Ruta.
          However, she seems to lack self-confidence, the best example being the
          memory where she tries to give Zelda something to think about to
          release her power: she hesitates, stutters a little, seems unsure of
          herself...
          <br />
          <br />
          During Ganon&apos;res resurrection, she will be killed by
          Ganon&apos;res Water Shadow, sent by him to replace her in her pilot
          role. She was a princess much loved by her people, who will never
          really recover from her loss, especially her educator, Etorpe who
          considered her as his own daughter. A statue of her will be erected in
          the center of the domain, but her people will still hate Link and by
          extension the Hylian people. The wound will only close when Link wakes
          up and frees Mipha and Vah&apos;reRuta, saving the domain. He will
          then speak with the soul of Mipha who will entrust him with his
          healing powers: the Prayer of Mipha. She will then place Ruta in a way
          to hurt Ganon and express her regrets for not having seen her father
          again. She will leave at the end of the game with the souls of the
          King and the other Prodigies.

        <img src="src/assets/images/Daruk.webp" alt="status" />
        <p>
          Daruk is the Prodigy of the Gorons and one of their great warriors. He
          looks a lot like Darunia from Ocarina of Time. His name is inspired by
          it, as well as that of his divine creature, Vah&apos;re-Rudania. He
          can create an invincible magic shield, Daruk&apos;res shield, which he
          will pass on to Link and his descendants. He is also the ancestor of
          Yunobo, who will inherit his Prodigy&apos;res scarf and his shield. He
          is very warm and friendly, and enjoys teasing Link. He is also a
          leader, he proves it by giving directives to the Prodigies during the
          resurrection of Ganon. He will nevertheless die like the other
          Prodigies, killed by Ganon&apos;res Shadow of Fire. A statue in his
          likeness was erected in Goron village.
          <br />
          <br />
          One hundred years later, he will be saved by Link. Daruk will thank
          him, while regretting not being able to protect the gorons anymore.
          But, by positioning the Divine creature to hurt Ganon, he will see
          Yunobo. His regrets will then disappear.
          <br />
          <br />
          He will be seen again at the end of the game, with the souls of the
          other Prodigies and the King of Hyrule observing Link and Zelda.

      <section className="one">
        <img src="src/assets/images/Revali.webp" alt="status" />
        <p>
          Revali is the Prodigy of the Piafs and, according to him, the best
          archer of his people. He rules the divine creature Vah&apos;reMedoh
          and has the ability to create updrafts allowing him to fly very fast
          and very high in the sky. He is also the only Piaf able to manipulate
          the Arc de l&apos;reAigle. Quite arrogant, Revali believes that the
          role of fighting Ganon should be up to him and complains that he has
          to be content to be at the service of Link and his &quot;rusty old
          sword&quot;. He will be killed by Ganon&apos;res Shadow Wind, shortly
          after Ganon&apos;res resurrection. His soul will then remain a
          prisoner of the divine creature until Link&apos;res awakening, a
          hundred years later. He will then be forced to recognize the
          legitimacy of the hero as the chosen one when the latter releases his
          soul, and he will apologize to him. After Ganon&apos;res defeat, at
          the end of the game, we see him again observing Link and Zelda in the
          company of the souls of the other Prodigies and the King of Hyrule. A
          square is named in his name in the village of Piaf. He is, with
          Urbosa, the only Prodigy to have no regrets.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section className="two">
        <img src="src/assets/images/Urbosa.webp" alt="status" />
        <p>
          Urbosa is the Prodigy of the Gerudos and their queen, as well as the
          ancestor of Riju. She pilots the divine creature Vah&apos;re Naboris
          and can bring down lightning thanks to her power, the Wrath of Urbosa.
          She seems to take on the role of Impa in this Zelda, showing herself
          to be very maternal and protective of the princess, she will moreover
          defend her in front of the other Prodigies during the dubbing of Link.
          She has the Mask of Thunder, which allows you to resist lightning. She
          will be killed by Ganon&apos;res Shadow Lightning. One hundred years
          later, she will be saved by Link and give him her power. She will also
          tell him that it is not his fault that they failed against Ganon, and
          to take care of the Princess. Then, she will place the Divine Creature
          in such a way as to hurt Ganon. After that, she will express her
          desires for revenge towards Ganon, on the one hand for having killed
          her and her friends a hundred years before, and on the other hand to
          wash away the humiliation done to her people, Ganon being, basically,
          a Gerudo. She will also cite in her speech the origin of the names of
          the divine creatures: the sages of Ocarina of Time and The Wind Waker.
          <br />
          <br />
          His last words heard in the game are also encouragement towards Zelda.
          She will be seen again at the top of Hyrule Castle observing Link and
          Zelda after their victories against Ganon.
